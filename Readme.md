# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

## Features

- User-friendly interface: The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface for entering a string to be checked.
- Real-time validation: As the user types, the application instantly validates whether the input is a palindrome or not.
- Case-insensitive: The checker ignores the case of the input string, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as equal.
- Ignoring special characters: The checker ignores any special characters, such as spaces, punctuation marks, and symbols, while determining if the input is a palindrome.
- Error handling: The application handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful error messages to the user in case of invalid input.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a string in the input field.
3. The application will instantly display whether the entered string is a palindrome or not.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure and layout of the web page.
- CSS: The styling and visual appearance of the web page.
- JavaScript: The logic and functionality of the palindrome checker.
